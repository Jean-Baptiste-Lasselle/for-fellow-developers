## The BOFH : The BAstard Operator From Hell

Oneof those times,I was crawling source code examples forthe well-known [`dock_auth`](https://github.com/cesanta/docker_auth), and [soon](https://github.com/cesanta/docker_auth/blob/master/examples/ext_auth.sh) I understand some variable value,`bofh`, is a possible username a user can type...

So I google upthe string `bofh`,  : 

![ohshit bofh](https://github.com/Jean-Baptiste-Lasselle/for-fellow-developers/raw/master/docuementation/impr.ecrans/BOFH_THE_BASTARD_OPERATOR_FROM_HELL_OR_HEAVEN.png)

bingo, so funny and so appropriate : BOFH, for those who 's first language is english, is well known for _Bastard Operator From Hell_, I we guess so wel what taht is : 

You know, it's the imaginary operator you think of,when you write some code, that guy that is going to type or click exactly what will blow the fuck out of your software... Yes, you know him, it's the guy your colleagues talk to you about when you code o the same project, the "What if" guy.

Might feel a bit useless, but it's not. So totally not to me : Things like that are very imortant tounderstand, just as much important as it is important to know the story of the men around a theorem, to fully undersand the theorem.
